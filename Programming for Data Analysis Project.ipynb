    "\n",
    "Some key variables which influence the salary of an individual are age, gender, education, industry, and continuity of service.\n",

    "To begin, I will research these variables and their trends within the workforce, as well as how they may relate to one another. I will then investigate how these variables impact the annual salary of an individual.\n",
