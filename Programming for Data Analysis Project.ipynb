In contrast, farming and agriculture have a much higher proportion of males than females, and this category has a much higher incidence of primary and secondary education. \n",

    "The CSO performed analysis on mean weekly earnings based on administrative data (such as revenue) in 2018 [10] across a range of age bands. This data shows the 40-49 age group have the highest weekly earnings at €908.39, and the 15-24 age group have the lowest at €328.61. However, it is worth noting that this dataset includes both part time and full time employees, and it also includes bonuses and benefit in kind payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is difficult to accommodate for bonuses and similar add on payments, it is possible to take the part time employment into consideration. An annual minimum wage  of €20,483 equates to a weekly payment of €393.90. Therefore I shall take this number for the 15-24 age group, rather than the lower figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, so far, all of the proportion multipliers used have been increasing the overall value, the age multiplier will be used to decrease the overall value by setting the 40-49 band as 1, and all other age bands a smaller decimal value based on the percentage differences from the mean weekly salaries.\n",

    "The salary equation is now as follows:\n",

In reality, salaries would still show some variation for individuals who fall within all the same age, gender, industry and education categories.

    "Based on analysis performed by the CSO in 2018, the mean annual salary in Ireland was €44,180. This figure is much lower than the average salary of €65,647 in the simulated dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of factors which may contribute to the simulated dataset providing a higher average than the CSO figure:\n",
    "\n",
    " - As previously noted when analysing the impact of age, a lot of the data does not differentiate between basic salary and any bonus compensation or benefit in kind. As I could not account for this in the simulation, this has likely resulted in a higher than expected result overall.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The mean annual salary calculation performed by the CSO was not solely based on full time employees as the simulated dataset is.\n",
    " \n",
    "As seen in the histogram, the shape of the distribution is as expected; a sharp rise to the average value, and the frequency tailing off slower to low occurences for much larger salary amounts.\n",
