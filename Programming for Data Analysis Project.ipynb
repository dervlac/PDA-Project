Through inspection of the 2016 census data [4], it is clear from firgure 2.3 that the distribution of education levels has a significant level of variation between industries.\n",

However, the variation which occurs here is likely an echo of the variation due to industry and how frequently industries occur in each gender. For example, health care and social work is the most popular industry for females, which has a very high proportion of third level educated individuals. In contrast, farming and agriculture have a much higher proportion of males than females, and this category has a much higher incidence of primary and secondary education. \n",
    "\n",
